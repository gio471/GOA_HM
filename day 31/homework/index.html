    <!-- Pseudo-selectors are special keywords in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) used 
        to define the styling of elements based on their state, position, or a relationship 
        in the document tree, without requiring the use of additional classes or IDs. They allow you to target
         elements dynamically based on conditions that cannot be easily defined with traditional selectors. -->
